Things we cover in this example are:

- How to pull the data from public APIs
- Chekcing the sever status request

- Incorporating parameters in the GET request
- How to obtain historical data for exchange rates
- Testing incorrect responses from the server
- Creating a simple currency convertor
  - The user will pick the date
